      <description>The database query program is in Finnish. It has 5 functions. The database that I have used is from Helsinki University&amp;rsquo;s course &amp;ldquo;Tietokantojen perusteet&amp;rdquo;
How the program works:
 Calculate the total number of course credits earned in a given year Print all the transcript of study records of a given student in chronological order Print the distribution of study record grades for a given course Print the top x teachers who has given the most credits Close the program  You can see example how the database query program works here</description>

      <description>My goal was to find out how my home country Finland has developed since 1970 alongside the United States, which has dominated the world economy in recent decades and China, which has become the second largest economy in the recent years.

      <title>Digit recognizer - Handwritten digits classification</title>
      <link>https://janituononen.github.io/Portfolio/post/project-2/</link>

      <description>The purpose of the project was to use computer vision fundamentals including simple neural networks to find out how well the model can read handwritten digits. The project dataset contained 70000 (train data 42000 &amp;amp; test data 28000) images of handwritten digits. Handwritten digits varied from 0 to 9. I used Keras&amp;rsquo;s Sequential model to get over 99,5% accuracy.    You can see the whole project here</description>

      <title>Titanic - Machine learning from disaster</title>

      <description>I made a model that predicted which passengers survived from the Titanic shipwreck. Dataset had 1309 passengers and crew, 891 in training data and 418 in testing data. The Titanic had total of 2224 passengers and crew. I tried to find out correlation between surviving and sex,age etc.. I used train test split for training and testing data. From training data my best accuracy was with Decision tree classifier almost 94% right.</description>
